# UX Path Catalog: Praci iOS (native, as built)

Generated: 2026-11-04
Total Stories: 127 unique (130 written in 12 topic files; 3 merged as duplicates, see "Merged stories")
Coverage: 44 of 50 feature areas fully covered (88%); 5 more partly covered (98% with at least one story); 1 has no story. Details are in the Coverage Matrix.

This catalog replaces the plan-era catalog written on 2026-10-20. That catalog described a design-board plan; no Swift code existed then. Every story here was written from the built SwiftUI code in `apps/ios`. Nothing was run on a device or simulator, so each step says what the code does, not what anyone observed. The first run on a device is the job of `/ux-walker`; the walker's checklist is the next section. All names and figures in the stories are invented. The earlier topic files that describe planned features are kept in `topics/archive/`.

Inputs: `docs/ios-native/ux/discovery.md` and the twelve topic files in `docs/ios-native/ux/topics/`. Each story keeps a **Source** line with its topic file and local ID. The full steps, edge cases and expected results are in the topic file; this catalog carries the goal, paths and cross-references.

## Code findings to verify

This is the walker's checklist. Each line is something a topic agent flagged from reading the code. None has been observed on a device. They are ranked by likely user impact: first the owner-reported problem, then things that block a task, then silent failures, then wrong or stale information, then polish. "Stories" names the stories that walk the behavior. Paths are under `apps/ios/Sources/Praci` unless they start with `Packages/`.

### Owner-reported

1. **Inbox or an email does not scroll.** Not confirmed from code alone; check these in order, on the Inbox list and on the message screen. (a) `Shared/SafeHTMLView.swift` turns the web view's own scrolling off (`isScrollEnabled = false`) and copies its height from `contentSize`, starting at 1 pt; if the height never updates, the body is clipped and cannot be reached. The web view sits inside the vertical `ScrollView` of `Inbox/InboxMessageScreen.swift` (`MessageBody`, near line 218). (b) Wide table-based newsletters overflow past `max-width` with no horizontal pan or pinch zoom, so part of the mail is unreachable. (b2) The web view height follows `contentSize`, which is never smaller than the current frame, so it can grow but may not shrink after a reflow, and it starts at 1 pt until the first content-size callback. (c) Very long HTML sizes the web view to the whole content, so scrolling may stall or memory may climb. (d) On the list (`Inbox/List/InboxListView.swift`), check scrolling with search active, with a problem banner showing, and with the To do card above the groups. Stories: STORY-060, STORY-061, STORY-056, STORY-059, STORY-066.

### Blocks a task

2. `Thread/ThreadScreen.swift` has no `scrollDismissesKeyboard`, so dragging the transcript does not close the keyboard and a third of the screen stays covered (Compose, sign-in and Voice settings do set it). Agent thread. Stories: STORY-029, STORY-028.
3. `Thread/ThreadScreen.swift` (`onScrollGeometryChange`, about lines 92 to 103): while `atBottom` is true and content grows, the handler re-scrolls to the bottom; a small upward drag during a streaming reply can be pulled back, and drags under 48 pt never stop the following. Agent thread. Stories: STORY-027, STORY-026.
4. `Thread/ThreadScreen.swift` (about line 63): `loadOlder` runs from a spinner row's `onAppear` in a bottom-anchored `LazyVStack`. It has no error or retry (a failed page leaves a permanently spinning row), and prepending rows may jump the scroll position. Agent thread. Stories: STORY-028, STORY-034.
5. `Inbox/InboxScreen.swift`: there is no way to start a new message. `ComposeSheet` is created only in `InboxMessageScreen` (Reply, Reply all, Forward), so `ComposeMode.new` and the multi-account From picker are unreachable. Compose and Inbox. Stories: STORY-067, STORY-075.
6. `Settings/SettingsScreen.swift`: a signed-in user cannot reach the server sheet, so the "Changing servers signs you out." warning is unreachable and the only way to change servers is to sign out first. Sign-in. Stories: STORY-011, STORY-005.
7. Default server is a loopback address, which does not work on a real phone, so a fresh install cannot sign in until the user finds "Use a custom server" (and that button never shows the current host). `Packages/RakazoCore` `ServerEndpoint.swift`, `ServerView.swift`. Sign-in. Stories: STORY-001, STORY-005, STORY-006, STORY-007.
8. Push token registration is not wired (`App/NotificationRouter.swift`, `didRegister(token:)` is unused), so a fresh install may get no pushes and the Notifications "Send to" section stays hidden. Settings and trust. Stories: STORY-122, STORY-123.
9. `Thread/Approvals/*`: an agent that asks again with the reason "This chat read a meeting, so it asks first." cannot be cleared on iOS (no "Clear conversation" on the card or in the thread menu), so the same approval repeats. "Firewall" is also shown with no explanation. Approvals. Stories: STORY-043, STORY-035.
10. `Thread/Approvals/*`: the OAuth MCP card tells the person to finish in the web app and has no button; an abandoned "Connect" card keeps saying Connect and the agent is not told. Approvals. Stories: STORY-042, STORY-044.
11. `Meetings/CaptureController.swift`, `Meetings/MeetingsScreen.swift`: when Stop finishes while the user is on another screen, no meeting opens (auto-open only if the Meetings list is on top) and there is no toast or push, so the finished meeting is easy to miss. Meetings. Stories: STORY-077, STORY-086.
12. `Meetings/RecordingBar.swift`: after Stop while offline the bar stays on "Transcribing..." and never says it is waiting for the connection (it checks `transcribing` before the offline state). Meetings. Stories: STORY-082.
13. `Computer/ComputerScreen.swift`: closing the screen while holding control does not release the lease; the user keeps control until the server times it out, with no warning. Team computer. Stories: STORY-113, STORY-112.
14. `Computer/ComputerScreen.swift`, `ComputerKeyBar.swift`: the keyboard does not show after Take control (the user must find a small icon in a scrolling row), and "Skip" and "I'm done" appear only once control is held and the request is flagged. Team computer. Stories: STORY-111, STORY-112.
15. `App/NotificationRouter.swift`: the push router has no computer target and the thread draws no takeover card, so a takeover request is found only by opening the thread menu. Team computer. Stories: STORY-112, STORY-114.

### Fails silently

16. `Manage/AgentRowMenu.swift` (`catch {}` and `try?`): a failed pin, rename or archive shows nothing; rename to the same name or spaces just closes the alert. Home and spaces. Stories: STORY-016.
17. `DataRoom/*`: folder create with an empty name does nothing, and a share request answered with no link (null) does nothing, both with no message. Data room. Stories: STORY-093, STORY-098.
18. `Thread/Composer/*`: Copy gives no confirmation; React and Stop failures use one red notice line in the composer, far from the message, with no auto-dismiss. Agent thread. Stories: STORY-030, STORY-033.
19. `Inbox/Compose/ComposeSheet.swift`: "Save draft" success has no visible confirmation, and "Reconnect" and "writes off" banners name the fix but give no button. Compose. Stories: STORY-071, STORY-072.
20. `Inbox/Compose/ComposeSheet.swift`: Remove on an attachment in Reply or Reply all has no effect (`attachmentIds` is sent only for Forward), and there is no way to add an attachment or reopen a saved draft. Compose. Stories: STORY-069, STORY-071.
21. `Meetings/MeetingDetailScreen.swift`: a failed delete shows the alert title "Couldn't save that", the same title as a failed to-do save, so it does not say a delete failed. Meetings. Stories: STORY-084, STORY-080.
22. `Meetings/CaptureController.swift`: a phone call or Siri interruption leaves a gap in the audio and the user is not told. Meetings. Stories: STORY-083.
23. `Voice/DictationControl.swift`, `Voice/CallView.swift`: disabled Call, Dictate and Record controls during a recording give no reason; automatic hang-up on backgrounding leaves no message and cannot be resumed. Voice. Stories: STORY-046, STORY-048, STORY-049, STORY-055.
24. `Settings/*` Models: a failed default-model save shows its error as a footer and the list does not visibly roll back; closing the sheet mid-flow leaves the Home banner. Settings and trust. Stories: STORY-117, STORY-014.
25. `Thread/Approvals/SecretAskView.swift`: on a failed save the fields were already cleared, so the person types the credential again, and the error text is fixed because the server text could echo the secret. Approvals. Stories: STORY-041.
26. Hidden pages (`me.hiddenPages`) leave no placeholder or explanation, so a user who expects Finance cannot learn why it is absent. `Home/HomeScreen.swift`. Home and spaces. Stories: STORY-023.

### Stale list or screen after an action

27. Closing the Settings sheet does not reload the screen underneath. Finance, Legal and Cap table keep "No accounts yet" or "Scanning needs a model" after the user connects or adds a key (their load runs once from `.task`); the Inbox is not reloaded after "Reconnect"; Home may keep the "connect a model" banner until a pull to refresh. Every "Connect" button also opens Settings at its top level, not at Integrations or Models. `Finance/*`, `Legal/*`, `CapTable/*`, `Inbox/List/InboxListView.swift`, `Home/HomeModel.swift`. Stories: STORY-102, STORY-105, STORY-108, STORY-066, STORY-014.
28. Lists do not reload by themselves after a destructive action in a pushed screen: an archived message, a Cleanup run, a deleted meeting and a deleted artifact may still show until a pull to refresh. `Inbox/InboxMessageScreen.swift`, `Inbox/Cleanup/*`, `Meetings/MeetingsScreen.swift`, `Artifacts/*`. Stories: STORY-056, STORY-063, STORY-084, STORY-096.
29. Hide amounts is read once per page load (`FinanceModel`, `LegalModel`, `CapTableModel`), so toggling it in Settings does not mask Legal values or Cap table amounts already on screen. Business pages. Stories: STORY-104, STORY-103.
30. Inbox To do card loads once per screen visit and pull to refresh does not reload it; searching then clearing the field does not reload the full list until the empty query is submitted. `Inbox/Todos/*`, `Inbox/InboxScreen.swift`. Stories: STORY-064, STORY-059.
31. The check-your-email page uses an email field that is no longer visible, so Resend can fail after a relaunch; nothing detects that verification or a reset finished, and the reset and verification links do not open the app. `AuthenticationModel.swift`. Sign-in. Stories: STORY-002, STORY-003.
32. Cold start shows the Sign in screen ("Connecting...", with "Use a custom server") for a user with a saved session until restore finishes (`App/RootView.swift`). Sign-in. Stories: STORY-010.
33. The Data room AI consent sheet is checked once per app run by a static flag; "Not now" never returns until relaunch and files then may stay in "Reading..." forever. `DataRoom/DataRoomRows.swift`. Data room. Stories: STORY-092, STORY-088.
34. Share link state is held in the screen model, so leaving and re-entering an artifact or agent page forgets the link and the menu no longer offers Stop sharing (the user cannot revoke it from the app). `Artifacts/*`, `AgentPages/*`. Data room. Stories: STORY-098.

### Wrong or misleading information

35. `Voice/VoiceServer.swift`: the "Speak with" default disagrees with the settings screen (`@AppStorage` shows "This device" ticked; `bool(forKey:)` reads false when never written), so a user with a hosted provider hears the hosted voice while the screen says device. Voice. Stories: STORY-052, STORY-048.
36. `Manage/BotSettingsScreen.swift`: "Read replies aloud" is saved but no iOS code reads thread replies aloud; "Call sounds" and "Waiting sound" are saved but never read. The Voice settings sample line promises read-aloud. Voice. Stories: STORY-053, STORY-052.
37. `Voice/CallView.swift`: the call timer starts when the view is created, not when the call connects. The transcript `ScrollView` (about lines 124 to 140) has no bottom anchor, so the latest line can sit below the fold. "Dictate" disappears once the field has text. Voice. Stories: STORY-048, STORY-050, STORY-046.
38. `Thread/ThreadScreen.swift`: the "Offline. Messages send when you reconnect." line is global to the send queue, shows even on a thread with nothing pending, and appears only after a failed send; the agent stream may be down with no sign of it. Agent thread. Stories: STORY-032.
39. Group rows on Home never show "Working" or "Needs you" (status is always idle), and archiving a member agent may not change the group row. `Home/HomeRows.swift`. Home and spaces. Stories: STORY-015.
40. `Inbox/List/InboxListView.swift`: the account filter icon is the same for All and a single account, so the active account is invisible once the menu closes; with Gmail unreachable the search empty state shows the problem view instead of "No Results". Inbox. Stories: STORY-058, STORY-059.
41. `Packages/RakazoAPI/.../Models/Inbox.swift`: `InboxRow.pile` is decoded but no view shows it, so there is no pile filter, header or badge. Inbox. Stories: STORY-056.
42. `Shared/SafeHTMLView.swift`: mail inherits `color-scheme: light dark`, so a mail with a hard-coded white background and dark text can be unreadable or fully bright in dark mode. Inbox. Stories: STORY-060.
43. `Artifacts/ArtifactScreen.swift`, `Shared/SandboxedHTMLView.swift`: HTML artifacts run with scripts off (CSP `default-src 'none'`), so interactive content degrades silently, and the same content behaves differently on the Agent page. Image artifacts have a two-axis scroll view but no pinch zoom. Data room. Stories: STORY-095, STORY-094.
44. `AgentPages/AgentPageScreen.swift` (lines 22 to 26): full-screen `SandboxedHTMLView` with `ignoresSafeArea(edges: .bottom)` under the "Open chat" inset; page HTML that sets `100vh` or `overflow: hidden` cannot scroll, and pull to refresh reloads the page, not its live sources. Data room. Stories: STORY-097.
45. `Settings/Preferences/NotificationPreferencesScreen.swift`: no row for the iOS permission state or a link to iOS Settings, the permission prompt is requested at launch, and a refused prompt is never mentioned. Settings and trust. Stories: STORY-122.
46. Sign out appears twice (Settings list and Account) and neither confirms. `Settings/SettingsScreen.swift`, `Settings/Account/AccountScreen.swift`. Sign-in and Settings. Stories: STORY-009, STORY-126.
47. Deep links: `rakazo://open/bot/<id>` opens a bot thread but does not switch space (only push payloads carry `spaceId`); a link tapped while signed out may show a screen after sign-in; a push for a space the user left sets `spaceID` anyway. `App/Route.swift`, `App/NotificationRouter.swift`. Settings and trust, Meetings. Stories: STORY-123, STORY-085.
48. `Settings/Rules/ApprovalRulesScreen.swift`: the rule kind is free text, so a typo makes a rule that never matches. Settings and trust. Stories: STORY-121.
49. `Settings/*`: disconnecting the default model's provider removes the Default model section and brings the Home banner back on next load (not verified). Account deletion unregisters push before the delete call, so a failed delete leaves the device without push. Settings and trust. Stories: STORY-118, STORY-127.
50. `Finance/*`, `CapTable/*`: the Cap table empty state looks the same when Carta is connected but nothing has synced, and still offers "Connect Carta"; pull to refresh re-reads the table but starts no sync; the contract detail has no link to its source document. Business pages. Stories: STORY-108, STORY-107.

### Layout and polish

51. Fixed-height sheets with no scroll view: `Shared/ConsentSheet.swift` (`.medium` detent), the Data room consent sheet, `Meetings/RecordSheet.swift` (`.height(230/280)`, long error text may clip), `Spaces/*` sheets. At the largest Dynamic Type or with the keyboard up, Allow or Start can be clipped. Stories: STORY-120, STORY-092, STORY-087, STORY-077, STORY-019.
52. Recording bar: `App/AppShell.swift` adds `RecordingBar` as a top inset on Home and on every pushed screen; check that two bars never stack, that the bar is missing in sheets (Stop is unreachable from Settings) and that it sits above the keyboard and Compose on a small phone. Stories: STORY-022, STORY-086, STORY-077.
53. `Thread/ThreadScreen.swift`: "Jump to latest" has no unread count and a fixed 80 pt offset tuned for a one-line composer, so it can sit under a tall composer; Return sends and no line break can be typed; a draft is lost on leaving the thread; reaction capsules cannot be removed. Stories: STORY-027, STORY-031, STORY-032.
54. Nested scrolling: horizontal `ScrollView`s inside the vertical thread (`Thread/ThreadBlocks.swift` line 60 tables, `Thread/Composer/ComposerView.swift` line 135 chips, the New agent color row, the Computer key bar) may stall on diagonal drags. Stories: STORY-026, STORY-031, STORY-013, STORY-111.
55. `Computer/ScreenWebView.swift` (line 32): the remote desktop cannot scroll by design, the screen is a non-scrolling `VStack` that shrinks with the keyboard, and there is no landscape layout. Team computer. Stories: STORY-111.
56. `Home/HomeScreen.swift`: the space title menu has no chevron, so the switch is hard to discover; the Team computer row opens the first bot's computer whichever it is, and a space with no bots has no row. Stories: STORY-018, STORY-115.
57. `Settings/Integrations/*`: no rename and no email address for an account; agent access is one "Allow writes" switch with no per-agent control. Stories: STORY-119.
58. `ServerView.swift`: the https case shows no confirmation alert when signed out; the "Change server" alert path is dead code. Stories: STORY-005, STORY-011.

## Story Dependency Graph

Every story needs a signed-in session (STORY-001) unless it is in the sign-in topic. An indented story builds on the one above it, or needs its state.

## All Stories

Entries carry the goal, paths and cross-references. The full steps and expected results are in the source topic file.

### Sign-in and server

#### STORY-001: Sign in with email and password
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/sign-in-and-server.md STORY-001`
**Persona**: Maya Okafor, founder with an existing account, installing the app on a new phone
**Goal**: Reach Home with an existing account.
**Ideal path**: 4. Type Email, type Password, tap Sign in, land on Home.
**Alternate paths**: SSO button (STORY-004). Sign up first (STORY-002). No keyboard shortcut for submit is wired (no `onSubmit` on the fields), so the button is the only route.
**See also**: STORY-008, STORY-009

#### STORY-002: Sign up and verify email
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/sign-in-and-server.md STORY-002`
**Persona**: Priya Nair, first-time user on a server that requires email verification
**Goal**: Create an account, confirm the email, and sign in.
**Ideal path**: 6. Sign up, fill Name, Email, Password, submit, confirm in mail, sign in.
**Alternate paths**: Continue with SSO creates an account without verification (STORY-004). If the server does not require verification, submitting Sign up signs in directly and the story ends at step 4.

#### STORY-003: Reset a forgotten password
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/sign-in-and-server.md STORY-003`
**Persona**: Tomas Berg, locked out after changing phones
**Goal**: Get a reset email.
**Ideal path**: 4. Forgot password, type email, send, read notice.
**Alternate paths**: None in this app for a signed-out user. A signed-in user changes the password in Settings, Account, "Change password" (out of scope here).

#### STORY-004: Continue with single sign-on
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/sign-in-and-server.md STORY-004`
**Persona**: Dana Whitfield, team member whose company runs an SSO provider named "Acme ID"
**Goal**: Sign in without a password.
**Ideal path**: 2. Tap the SSO button, finish in the sheet.
**Alternate paths**: Password fields below the button when the server also allows them.

#### STORY-005: Point a fresh install at a company server (https)
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/sign-in-and-server.md STORY-005`
**Persona**: Tomas Berg, CTO running his own server at `praci.example.test`
**Goal**: Sign in against the company server instead of the built-in default.
**Ideal path**: 7. Open the sheet, type the address, Save, then Email, Password, Sign in.
**Alternate paths**: None; the server sheet is reachable only from the sign-in screen (the Settings screens have no Server row, and a signed-in user has no sheet to open without signing out first).
**See also**: STORY-011

#### STORY-006: Use a server on the local network over http
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/sign-in-and-server.md STORY-006`
**Persona**: Leo Marchetti, developer testing against a Mac on the same Wi-Fi
**Goal**: Connect over plain http to `http://192.168.1.20:3100`.
**Ideal path**: 5. Open sheet, type, Save, confirm, then sign in.
**Alternate paths**: None.
**See also**: STORY-011

#### STORY-007: Return to the default server
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/sign-in-and-server.md STORY-007`
**Persona**: Leo Marchetti, done testing
**Goal**: Go back to the built-in server.
**Ideal path**: 3. Open sheet, "Use default server", done.
**Alternate paths**: Type the default address by hand.

#### STORY-008: Session ended notice
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/sign-in-and-server.md STORY-008`
**Persona**: Maya Okafor, signed in for weeks
**Goal**: Recover when the server stops accepting her session.
**Ideal path**: 3. See the notice, type the password, Sign in.
**Alternate paths**: SSO if the server offers it.
**See also**: STORY-001, STORY-010

#### STORY-009: Sign out
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/sign-in-and-server.md STORY-009`
**Persona**: Dana Whitfield, handing her phone back to IT
**Goal**: End the session on this device.
**Ideal path**: 3. Settings, Sign out, done (no confirmation).
**Alternate paths**: Settings, Account, "Sign out" (a second button on the Account screen; both call the same function).
**See also**: STORY-001, STORY-126, STORY-127

#### STORY-010: Cold start with a saved session
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/sign-in-and-server.md STORY-010`
**Persona**: Maya Okafor, opening the app after a day
**Goal**: Get straight to Home.
**Ideal path**: 1. Launch; Home appears with no sign-in.
**Alternate paths**: Notification tap (deep link) after launch, handled once startup finishes.
**See also**: STORY-008, STORY-123

#### STORY-011: Change server while signed in
**Type**: long | **Source**: `topics/sign-in-and-server.md STORY-011`
**Persona**: Tomas Berg, moving his team from a test server to the production server
**Goal**: Switch the app to `https://praci.example.test` and sign in there.
**Ideal path**: 6. Sign out, open sheet, type, Save, Change server, sign in. (The app has no switch from inside Settings.)
**Alternate paths**: The sheet can only be opened from the sign-in page, so a signed-in user must sign out first; `ServerView` still has code for the signed-in case ("Changing servers signs you out."), but no screen in the signed-in app reaches it.
**See also**: STORY-005, STORY-006

### Home and spaces

#### STORY-012: Open the app and get to the agent I need
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/home-and-spaces.md STORY-H01`
**Persona**: Maya Okafor, solo founder of a four-person logistics startup, three agents set up
**Goal**: See which agent has something for her and open it
**Ideal path**: 2. One look at Home shows which agent needs her (unread dot, status text), one tap opens the thread.
**Alternate paths**: Tap the Inbox row for mail instead of an agent. Open a thread from a push notification (`NotificationRouter.open`). Pin the agent so it sits at the top (see H05).

#### STORY-013: First launch with no agents
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/home-and-spaces.md STORY-H02`
**Persona**: Tomas Reyes, new user, just verified his email
**Goal**: Create the first agent from an empty Home
**Ideal path**: 3. Tap "New agent" on the empty state, type a name, tap "Create".
**Alternate paths**: "New" (plus) in the nav bar, then "New agent" (same sheet). No other route.
**See also**: STORY-024

#### STORY-014: Connect a model from the Home banner
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/home-and-spaces.md STORY-H03`; `topics/settings-and-trust.md STORY-003`
**Persona**: Tomas Reyes
**Goal**: Make his agent able to answer
**Ideal path**: 4. Tap "Connect a model", pick a provider, finish the key or sign-in, return to Home with the banner gone.
**Alternate paths**: Settings (gear) then the Models screen reaches the same place. Opening the thread and trying to send does not offer a link (not verified in this pass; belongs to the thread-send topic).
**See also**: STORY-024, STORY-105, STORY-117

#### STORY-015: Create a group of agents
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/home-and-spaces.md STORY-H04`
**Persona**: Maya Okafor
**Goal**: Put Finance and Ops in one chat to plan a quarter
**Ideal path**: 5. Plus, "New group", name, pick two members, Create.
**Alternate paths**: From the empty-state "New agent" button for agents only; groups have one route (nav-bar plus menu).
**See also**: STORY-024

#### STORY-016: Pin, rename and archive from the row menu, then undo
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/home-and-spaces.md STORY-H05`
**Persona**: Maya Okafor
**Goal**: Tidy Home: pin Finance, rename "Inbox helper", archive an old agent by mistake and bring it back
**Ideal path**: 3 per action (long-press, choose, confirm if needed). Undo adds 1.
**Alternate paths**: The same actions exist in the agent's Settings screen (row menu "Settings"). Archive also reachable from agent Settings, which pops to Home and shows the same toast. Archived items are restored from Settings, Archived. Pin has no other route found.
**See also**: STORY-053, STORY-125

#### STORY-017: A crowded roster: show more, sections and collapse
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/home-and-spaces.md STORY-H06`
**Persona**: Priya Nair, head of operations at a 30-person startup, 12 agents and groups
**Goal**: Reach an agent that is below the fold in a custom section
**Ideal path**: 3. Scroll, tap the section header to expand, tap the row.
**Alternate paths**: Pull to refresh does not change what is visible. Section assignment is only changed from an agent's Settings screen (a "Section" picker); no creation or editing of sections on Home was found in the code.

#### STORY-018: Switch to another space
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/home-and-spaces.md STORY-H07`
**Persona**: Priya Nair, owns "Brightwell Labs" and is also invited to "Brightwell Advisory"
**Goal**: See the other space's agents
**Ideal path**: 2. Tap the title, pick the space.
**Alternate paths**: Opening a push notification for another space switches `app.spaceID` automatically. Nothing else on Home switches space.

#### STORY-019: Create a space and rename it
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/home-and-spaces.md STORY-H08`
**Persona**: Priya Nair
**Goal**: Start a clean workspace for a side project and fix a typo in its name
**Ideal path**: 4. Plus, "New space", name, Create (then 4 more for a rename).
**Alternate paths**: Title menu, "New space" reaches the same sheet. Rename only through title menu, "Space settings".

#### STORY-020: Delete a space
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/home-and-spaces.md STORY-H09`
**Persona**: Priya Nair
**Goal**: Remove the unused "Side project" space
**Ideal path**: 3. Title menu, Space settings, Delete space, confirm (4 with the confirm).
**Alternate paths**: none found

#### STORY-021: Pull to refresh with a flaky connection
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/home-and-spaces.md STORY-H10`
**Persona**: Maya Okafor on a train with weak signal
**Goal**: Check for new messages
**Ideal path**: 1. Pull down; if it fails, one tap on "Try again".
**Alternate paths**: Returning from any pushed screen reloads Home quietly; an agents-changed notification also reloads it.

#### STORY-022: Check Home while a recording is running
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/home-and-spaces.md STORY-H11`
**Persona**: Maya Okafor, mid-meeting
**Goal**: Leave the recording running, look at an agent's reply, and stop the recording afterwards
**Ideal path**: 3. Tap back to Home, tap the agent, later tap "Stop" on the bar.
**Alternate paths**: Stop also from the recording screen or sheet in Meetings (not covered here).
**See also**: STORY-077, STORY-086

#### STORY-023: Find Finance and Legal pages when some are hidden
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/home-and-spaces.md STORY-H12`
**Persona**: Jordan Lee, an invited advisor with limited access
**Goal**: Open the Meetings page and see why Finance is missing
**Ideal path**: 2. Scroll to Pages, tap Meetings.
**Alternate paths**: none found for pages other than Meetings, which is also opened from a push or from meeting-related links.
**See also**: STORY-085, STORY-099, STORY-115

### Agent thread

#### STORY-024: Open a busy thread and land on the newest reply
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/agent-thread.md STORY-001`
**Persona**: Founder who checks an agent a few times a day
**Goal**: Read the newest reply from "Ledger" without scrolling
**Ideal path**: 1. Tapping the agent row on Home should land on the newest message.
**Alternate paths**: Push notification tap opens the same thread (`app.open`); Home search or pinned row. Same screen, same landing.
**See also**: STORY-013, STORY-014, STORY-015

#### STORY-025: Return to a thread with unread replies and the "New" divider
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/agent-thread.md STORY-002`
**Persona**: Founder who left a long research task running overnight
**Goal**: Start reading at the first reply they have not seen
**Ideal path**: 1. The thread opens at the first unread message with a clear marker; reaching the end marks it read automatically.
**Alternate paths**: The unread dot or count on the Home row leads here; no other path to the divider. "Mark unread" in the message menu recreates a divider later (see Variations).
**See also**: STORY-123

#### STORY-026: Watch a reply stream in and follow it
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/agent-thread.md STORY-003`
**Persona**: Founder asking for a summary and waiting for it
**Goal**: See the answer appear without touching the screen
**Ideal path**: 2. Send the question; the screen stays pinned to the growing reply.
**Alternate paths**: none found (streaming is the only way a reply arrives; reopening the thread shows the finished message).
**See also**: STORY-045

#### STORY-027: Scroll up during a streaming reply without being pulled back
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/agent-thread.md STORY-004`
**Persona**: Founder who wants to re-read an earlier answer while the agent is still writing
**Goal**: Look at an older message while a reply keeps streaming, then return to the live edge
**Ideal path**: 3. Drag up to the old message; the screen stays put and shows a way back to the live reply; one tap returns.
**Alternate paths**: Dragging back down by hand to the end also returns (and the button disappears). Tapping the status-bar area is not handled specially (iOS default scroll-to-top applies, which jumps to the oldest loaded message and triggers older-page loading).

#### STORY-028: Scroll back through history and load older messages
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/agent-thread.md STORY-005`
**Persona**: Founder looking for a number "Ledger" gave three weeks ago
**Goal**: Reach old messages by scrolling up
**Ideal path**: 2. Drag up repeatedly; older pages appear without any extra tap and without the view jumping.
**Alternate paths**: none found in the thread (there is no in-thread search or date jump on iOS). The same facts may be in Artifacts or the Agent page from the toolbar menu.

#### STORY-029: Dismiss the keyboard by dragging the list
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/agent-thread.md STORY-006`
**Persona**: Founder who typed half a message and wants to read a reply behind the keyboard
**Goal**: Get the keyboard out of the way while reading
**Ideal path**: 1. Drag the message list down and the keyboard follows the finger and dismisses.
**Alternate paths**: Tapping elsewhere does nothing (no tap-to-dismiss on the list). The Return key sends rather than dismisses. Swiping down on the keyboard itself is not available on iPhone. Leaving the screen with Back dismisses it.

#### STORY-030: Copy, reply to and react to an agent message
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/agent-thread.md STORY-007`
**Persona**: Founder acting on a finished answer
**Goal**: Copy a figure, ask a follow-up on one paragraph, and thumbs-up the answer
**Ideal path**: 3. Long-press the reply and tap Copy; long-press and tap Reply; long-press, React, Like.
**Alternate paths**: React and Reply are only in the long-press menu; no swipe-to-reply and no double-tap. Reactions can also arrive from the web app and are shown the same way.
**See also**: STORY-038

#### STORY-031: Attach files and photos, then send
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/agent-thread.md STORY-008`
**Persona**: Founder sending a contract and a photo of a whiteboard
**Goal**: Send a PDF and a photo with one instruction
**Ideal path**: 4. Plus, pick items, type, Send.
**Alternate paths**: Photos and Files are in the same "+" menu; no paste of images from the clipboard and no drag-and-drop. Camera capture is not offered from the "+" menu.

#### STORY-032: Send while offline, then recover
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/agent-thread.md STORY-009`
**Persona**: Founder in a lift or on a train
**Goal**: Not lose a message written without signal
**Ideal path**: 2. Type and send; the message waits and delivers on its own when the connection returns.
**Alternate paths**: Per-message "Retry" and "Delete" exist both as a visible button and in the long-press menu on a pending message; two ways to the same actions.
**See also**: STORY-038, STORY-073

#### STORY-033: Stop a run and send a correction
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/agent-thread.md STORY-010`
**Persona**: Founder who just realized they asked about the wrong quarter
**Goal**: Halt the agent and redirect it
**Ideal path**: 2. Tap Stop, then type and send the correction.
**Alternate paths**: none found (no Stop in the toolbar menu). Voice call hang-up ends the call, not the run.
**See also**: STORY-035

#### STORY-034: Long session: catch up, scroll back, attach, lose signal, stop, react
**Type**: long | **Source**: `topics/agent-thread.md STORY-011`
**Persona**: Founder preparing a board update on a commute
**Goal**: Use the thread through a whole working session across the features above
**Ideal path**: 
**Alternate paths**: none recorded

### Approvals

#### STORY-035: Allow a payment tool once
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/approvals.md STORY-001`
**Persona**: Priya Nandakumar, founder of a 6-person logistics startup, Mercury agent connected
**Goal**: Let the agent send a pilot invoice payment after reading what it will do
**Ideal path**: 2. Read the card, tap the one prominent button. The payment label already says the amount, so no second confirmation is needed.
**Alternate paths**: Answer the same card from the web app or Expo app; the iOS card changes to the resolved line after the next thread refresh. Settings > "Allowed without asking" can pre-approve the tool so the card never appears.
**See also**: STORY-033, STORY-121

#### STORY-036: Deny a tool call and see the resolved line
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/approvals.md STORY-002`
**Persona**: Marcus Oyelaran, operations lead
**Goal**: Stop an agent from running a tool he does not recognise
**Ideal path**: 1. Tap "Deny".
**Alternate paths**: Do not answer and instead type a new message; the run continues and the old card later shows "Replaced by a newer request" or "Stopped".

#### STORY-037: A card that is no longer active
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/approvals.md STORY-003`
**Persona**: Hana Kobayashi, returns to a thread after lunch
**Goal**: Understand what happened to a request she did not answer
**Ideal path**: 1. Open the thread and read the resolved line.
**Alternate paths**: none found

#### STORY-038: Answer a free-text question from the agent
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/approvals.md STORY-004`
**Persona**: Devon Whitfield, founder
**Goal**: Tell the agent which Mercury account to pay from
**Ideal path**: 2. Type the answer, tap "Send answer".
**Alternate paths**: Reply in the normal composer. This sends a new message instead of answering the card, so the card ends as "Replaced by a newer request" or stays pending depending on the run.
**See also**: STORY-030, STORY-032

#### STORY-039: Pick an option on a choice card, or dismiss it
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/approvals.md STORY-005`
**Persona**: Aisha Rahman, new user in first-run onboarding
**Goal**: Choose what the agent should help with first
**Ideal path**: 2. Tap an option row, tap "Continue".
**Alternate paths**: Tap the small close (xmark, label "Dismiss") at the top right to skip.

#### STORY-040: Send, save or discard a drafted email
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/approvals.md STORY-006`
**Persona**: Tomasz Wrona, founder, Gmail agent connected
**Goal**: Review an email the agent wrote to an investor, then send it
**Ideal path**: 2. Read the card, tap "Send".
**Alternate paths**: Tell the agent in the composer what to change; the agent then asks again with a new card. There is no edit screen on iOS. The Inbox draft view is a separate route to the same email.
**See also**: STORY-062, STORY-067

#### STORY-041: Give the agent a password or API key
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/approvals.md STORY-007`
**Persona**: Lena Fischer, founder
**Goal**: Give the agent an API key for a vendor so it can continue
**Ideal path**: 3. Paste into the secure field, tap "Save"; a password manager fill counts as the paste.
**Alternate paths**: Settings > Integrations holds connected apps, but not agent-requested keys; no other route.

#### STORY-042: Approve an agent-created MCP server
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/approvals.md STORY-008`
**Persona**: Ravi Subramanian, founder
**Goal**: Let the agent connect a docs search server it created
**Ideal path**: 1. Tap "Approve".
**Alternate paths**: Settings > Integrations lists connections after they exist but has no approval for a pending agent-created server.

#### STORY-043: See why a call asks, including Firewall and meeting reasons
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/approvals.md STORY-009`
**Persona**: Joanna Mbeki, founder who recently asked an agent to summarise a recorded meeting
**Goal**: Understand why an agent that normally sends mail on its own is now asking
**Ideal path**: 3. Read the reason, decide, and answer. To stop the asking she would need to clear the conversation, which iOS cannot do.
**Alternate paths**: Web app: the meeting reason has a "Clear conversation" link beside it and the bot context menu offers "Clear conversation". iOS has no equivalent on the card or in the thread menu.
**See also**: STORY-121

#### STORY-044: Connect an app the agent needs
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/approvals.md STORY-010`; `topics/settings-and-trust.md STORY-005`
**Persona**: Marta Delgado, founder
**Goal**: Connect Mercury so the agent can read balances
**Ideal path**: 3. Tap "Connect", finish in the browser, close the sheet.
**Alternate paths**: Home > Settings > Integrations (the same screen, opened without leaving the thread).
**See also**: STORY-102, STORY-108, STORY-119

#### STORY-045: Two cards waiting, answer the right one
**Type**: long | **Source**: `topics/approvals.md STORY-011`
**Persona**: Priya Nandakumar, back after a meeting
**Goal**: Clear a backlog of requests from one agent without approving the wrong one
**Ideal path**: 4. Scroll to the latest card, answer it, then answer the next.
**Alternate paths**: none found
**See also**: STORY-026

### Voice

#### STORY-046: Dictate a message into the composer
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/voice.md STORY-V01`
**Persona**: Founder walking between meetings, phone in one hand
**Goal**: Say a request to the "Finance" agent instead of typing it
**Ideal path**: 2 (tap the mic, speak; it stops on its own and the text is ready to send)
**Alternate paths**: Voice call (STORY-V03) for a spoken back-and-forth; no keyboard dictation shortcut is built into the app (the iOS keyboard's own mic still works in the text field)
**See also**: STORY-047

#### STORY-047: Dictation blocked by a denied permission
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/voice.md STORY-V02`
**Persona**: User who tapped "Don't Allow" once by reflex
**Goal**: Understand why the mic does nothing and fix it
**Ideal path**: 2 (read the notice, tap Open Settings)
**Alternate paths**: Go to iOS Settings → Praci manually
**See also**: STORY-046

#### STORY-048: Start a voice call and hold a conversation
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/voice.md STORY-V03`
**Persona**: Founder driving, hands-free after the first tap
**Goal**: Ask the "Chief of staff" agent for a rundown and get it spoken back
**Ideal path**: 2 (tap Call, talk)
**Alternate paths**: Dictation plus reading the reply (STORY-V01); there is no read-aloud action on a message
**See also**: STORY-049, STORY-051

#### STORY-049: Call with permission denied
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/voice.md STORY-V04`
**Persona**: User who denied the microphone earlier
**Goal**: Get a call working
**Ideal path**: 2 (tap Open Settings in the call, allow, return)
**Alternate paths**: iOS Settings → Praci
**See also**: STORY-048

#### STORY-050: Mute, read the transcript, and the live caption
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/voice.md STORY-V05`
**Persona**: User in an open office who wants to silence the mic for a moment
**Goal**: Mute, read what was said, unmute
**Ideal path**: 3 (Mute, Transcript, Mute)
**Alternate paths**: Read the same exchanges later in the thread

#### STORY-051: Call interrupted by backgrounding or hang-up from the agent
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/voice.md STORY-V06`
**Persona**: User who gets a text and switches app mid-call
**Goal**: Know what happened to the call
**Ideal path**: 1 (return and see the thread)
**Alternate paths**: none found
**See also**: STORY-048

#### STORY-052: Choose how the agent sounds (voice settings)
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/voice.md STORY-V07`
**Persona**: Power user who wants a nicer voice than the phone's
**Goal**: Connect a hosted voice, pick a voice, hear it
**Ideal path**: 6 (Settings, Voice, provider, paste key, Connect, pick voice)
**Alternate paths**: Meeting "Add speech to text" link (STORY-V09) reaches the same Voice screen; Home has no direct link
**See also**: STORY-054

**Goal**: Find last month's investor call.
**Ideal path**: 3. Pull the search field, type a word, tap the row.
**Alternate paths**: Ask an agent in a thread (not a Meetings feature). Data room > Recordings holds the same meetings as Markdown notes with its own search, and the Data room search finds text there too. No search inside a single meeting's transcript.

**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/meetings.md STORY-005`
**Persona**: Naledi Mokoena

**Ideal path**: 3. Open the meeting, scan, tap the circle on the to-do.

**See also**: STORY-064

#### STORY-081: Wait for a summary, then see it appear
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/meetings.md STORY-006`
**Persona**: Priya Raman
**Goal**: Confirm that a just-recorded call turns into a summary and a Recordings note.
**Ideal path**: 2. The meeting opens by itself after Stop, and the summary appears by itself. After that the user should be told in one place where the notes went.
**Alternate paths**: Open Home > the Hex agent thread to find the server-written "Summarizing your new meeting" line with a link to the Recordings item (see facts). Open Data room > Recordings to find the note directly. Reopen Meetings later.
**See also**: STORY-085

#### STORY-082: Stop and wait while the recording is being stored
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/meetings.md STORY-007`
**Persona**: Tomás Herrera

#### STORY-086: Recording while using the rest of the app
**Type**: long | **Source**: `topics/meetings.md STORY-011`
**Persona**: Priya Raman
**Goal**: Run a 45-minute call while reading mail, asking an agent a question and checking Settings.
**Ideal path**: 0 extra actions for the recording. The bar should never be in the way.
**Alternate paths**: none found. Settings is a sheet, so the bar is not shown while it is open; the only way to Stop from there is to close it.
**See also**: STORY-022, STORY-055

#### STORY-087: Start recording is refused because one already runs
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/meetings.md STORY-012`
**Persona**: Tomás Herrera

**Ideal path**: 3 — type in search, read the snippet, tap the hit.
**Alternate paths**: (a) Failed-files filter shows only files that failed (no text search). (b) Search is per folder when started inside a subfolder (filters on that folder), so the same query gives different results at the root.

**Persona**: Tomas Lindqvist, operator of a two-person logistics software company
**Goal**: Open a computer that is stopped and see the desktop.
**Ideal path**: 2 - open computer (it starts by itself), read the screen.
**Alternate paths**: (a) tap "Start computer" in the placeholder if the auto start is not wanted to be waited on (it does the same call); (b) "Take control" on a suspended computer wakes it and takes control in one step; (c) none other.

#### STORY-111: Take control and type a one-time code
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/team-computer.md STORY-003`
**Persona**: Priya Raman, founder
**Goal**: Fill a login code into a vendor page on the agent's desktop.
**Ideal path**: 5 - Take control, tap the field, Show keyboard, type, Release control.
**Alternate paths**: none found.

#### STORY-112: Answer a takeover request from the agent
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/team-computer.md STORY-004`
**Persona**: Jordan Reyes, investor-relations lead
**Goal**: The agent needs the user to log in by hand; do it and hand back.
**Ideal path**: 4 - notice the request, Open computer, log in, "I'm done".
**Alternate paths**: (a) open from the thread menu "Open computer"; (b) Home "Team computer" row (only if this is the first bot); (c) tapping a notification does not open the computer (no computer target in the notification router).
**See also**: STORY-111, STORY-113

#### STORY-113: Release control without finishing
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/team-computer.md STORY-005`
**Persona**: Tomas Lindqvist
**Goal**: Hand the computer back to the agent after poking at something.
**Ideal path**: 1 - "Release control".
**Alternate paths**: (a) "Close" without releasing keeps the lease; the server expires it (the app does not release on close, only stops polling); (b) none other.
**See also**: STORY-112

#### STORY-114: Come back after leaving the app
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/team-computer.md STORY-006`
**Persona**: Maya Okafor
**Goal**: Resume watching after a phone call.
**Ideal path**: 1 - return to the app.
**Alternate paths**: none found.
**See also**: STORY-111

#### STORY-115: Open the first computer from Home
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/team-computer.md STORY-007`
**Persona**: New user with three agents
**Goal**: Find "the Team computer" from Home.
**Ideal path**: 2 - tap Team computer, read the screen.
**Alternate paths**: thread menu "Open computer" (per agent).

### Settings and trust

#### STORY-116: Check what Settings currently says and close it
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/settings-and-trust.md STORY-001`
**Persona**: Priya Nair, solo founder with a hosted model connected
**Goal**: See her name, then get back to Home.
**Ideal path**: 2 (open Settings, read, Done). The gear opens it and "Done" closes it.
**Alternate paths**: The thread toolbar menu has "Settings", but for a bot it opens the bot's settings, not this sheet (see Manage/BotSettingsScreen). The Integrations screen can also be reached from an agent's "Connect" card (STORY-005). Account is reachable from the profile row only.

#### STORY-117: Switch the default model and its thinking level
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/settings-and-trust.md STORY-002`
**Persona**: Marcus Webb, founder who cares about cost
**Goal**: Move agents to a cheaper model and lower the thinking level.
**Ideal path**: 4 (Models, Model row, pick a model, optional Thinking menu).
**Alternate paths**: none found. The model chooser lists only models of connected providers; connecting another provider is a separate path (STORY-003).
**See also**: STORY-014

#### STORY-118: Replace and remove a provider key
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/settings-and-trust.md STORY-004`
**Persona**: Marcus Webb
**Goal**: Rotate an API key, then disconnect an unused provider.
**Ideal path**: 3 for rotating (provider row, paste key, Save key); 2 for removing (provider row, Disconnect, confirm = 3).
**Alternate paths**: none found.
**See also**: STORY-105

#### STORY-119: Review a connected account, allow writes, then reconnect it
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/settings-and-trust.md STORY-006`
**Persona**: Priya Nair
**Goal**: Let bots send mail from her work Gmail, knowing each send still needs her approval.
**Ideal path**: 3 (Integrations, the account row, Allow writes plus confirm = 4).
**Alternate paths**: Writes can be gated per tool through "Allowed without asking" (STORY-008). An agent's mail approval card also controls single sends.
**See also**: STORY-044, STORY-058, STORY-066, STORY-075

#### STORY-120: Withdraw AI data sharing, then recover a paused agent
**Type**: long | **Source**: `topics/settings-and-trust.md STORY-007`
**Persona**: Marcus Webb, privacy-conscious
**Goal**: Stop sending recordings to a voice provider, and understand why agents stopped when he switched model sharing off.
**Ideal path**: 3 (AI data sharing, switch off, done). Re-allowing is 3 (switch on, Allow in sheet).
**Alternate paths**: The same consent sheet appears the first time an agent run needs a recipient (`app.consent.ensure`), so granting is available inside the thread flow and in Settings.
**See also**: STORY-092, STORY-105

#### STORY-121: Add an approval rule and stop asking for a trusted action
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/settings-and-trust.md STORY-008`
**Persona**: Marcus Webb
**Goal**: Let agents archive mail without asking, but block posting to social sites.
**Ideal path**: 4 (Allowed without asking, add, name and action, Save).
**Alternate paths**: Approving a card in the thread covers one case; "Always allow" style choices on cards may create rules (see the approvals topic). Rules can be edited here by changing a row's menu.
**See also**: STORY-035, STORY-043

#### STORY-122: Choose which alerts reach the phone
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/settings-and-trust.md STORY-009`
**Persona**: Priya Nair
**Goal**: Get told when an agent needs her, not when it finishes.
**Ideal path**: 3 (Settings, Notifications, switch off Finishes).
**Alternate paths**: iOS system settings for the app. There is no link to it from this screen and no row showing whether iOS permission was granted.
**See also**: STORY-123

#### STORY-123: Tap a push and land in the right thread
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/settings-and-trust.md STORY-010`
**Persona**: Marcus Webb
**Goal**: Open the thread an agent pinged him from, in the correct space.
**Ideal path**: 1 (tap the notification).
**Alternate paths**: `rakazo://open/bot/<id>` opens a bot thread but does not switch space; only push payloads carry `spaceId`.
**See also**: STORY-010, STORY-025, STORY-085, STORY-122

#### STORY-124: Look at usage, hide amounts and set the look
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/settings-and-trust.md STORY-011`
**Persona**: Priya Nair, about to share her screen
**Goal**: Hide dollar amounts and use dark mode.
**Ideal path**: 3 (Hide amounts switch, Appearance menu, choose Dark).
**Alternate paths**: none found for the switch. Usage is read only.
**See also**: STORY-104

#### STORY-125: Restore an archived agent
**Type**: short | **Source**: `topics/settings-and-trust.md STORY-012`
**Persona**: Priya Nair
**Goal**: Bring back the Research agent she archived last week.
**Ideal path**: 2 (Archived agents, Restore).
**Alternate paths**: Bot settings has an archive/restore action (Manage/BotSettingsScreen). The Home row menu and thread menu only archive, with an undo toast.
**See also**: STORY-016

#### STORY-126: Change the password, then sign out
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/settings-and-trust.md STORY-013`
**Persona**: Marcus Webb
**Goal**: Change the account password and sign out of a shared iPad-style handoff.
**Ideal path**: 4 for the password (profile row, Change password, three fields, Save password); 1 for sign out.
**Alternate paths**: "Sign out" is both on the Settings list and on Account.
**See also**: STORY-009

#### STORY-127: Delete the account
**Type**: medium | **Source**: `topics/settings-and-trust.md STORY-014`
**Persona**: Marcus Webb, closing the account
**Goal**: Permanently delete the account.
**Ideal path**: 4 (Account, Delete account, enter proof, Delete).
**Alternate paths**: none found.
**See also**: STORY-009


## ID Map

Topic files reuse local IDs such as STORY-001, so each local ID is mapped to its catalog ID here. Local IDs are the number after the topic's own prefix (`H` for Home and spaces, `V` for Voice, `INB-` for Inbox).

## Merged stories

- STORY-014 (Connect a model from the Home banner) absorbs the Settings and trust story of the same name (`settings-and-trust.md` STORY-003). Both used the same sheet and goal; the Settings version's failure cases (local server on another network, closing the sheet mid-flow) are kept in the Settings topic file and findings 24 and 27.
- STORY-054 (Record a meeting when speech to text is not set up) absorbs `meetings.md` STORY-003, which describes the same sheet row "Add speech to text" and the same route to Voice settings.
- STORY-044 (Connect an app the agent needs) absorbs `settings-and-trust.md` STORY-005 (Connect Calendar when an agent asks). The card, its sheet and the Integrations flow are the same; only the app differs.

Stories that overlap but were kept because they test different outcomes: STORY-062 with STORY-067 and STORY-069 (the Inbox story goes through the message screen and archive; the Compose stories cover the sheet's fields and failures), STORY-104 with STORY-124 (the first checks the other pages, the second covers usage and appearance too), STORY-120 with STORY-092 (withdrawing consent versus first-visit consent), and STORY-009 with STORY-126 (sign out versus change password first).

## Cross-references between topics

| Link | Why they connect |
| --- | --- |
| Sign-in and server -> Settings and trust | Sign out and server change meet in STORY-009, STORY-011 and STORY-126. |
| Home and spaces -> Settings and trust | The model banner and Archived agents meet in STORY-014 and STORY-125; the gear opens Settings. |
| Home and spaces -> Meetings | The recording bar shows on Home (STORY-022) and on pushed screens (STORY-086). |
| Agent thread -> Approvals | Approval cards live in the thread; STORY-045 depends on thread behavior in STORY-026. |
| Agent thread -> Voice | The mic and the phone button are in the composer and toolbar (STORY-046, STORY-048). |
| Approvals -> Settings and trust | "Allowed without asking" removes cards (STORY-121); connect cards open Integrations (STORY-044, STORY-119). |
| Approvals -> Compose | The mail approval card sends mail the agent drafted (STORY-040) while Compose sends mail the person wrote (STORY-067). |
| Inbox -> Compose | Reply and Forward are reached only from the message screen (STORY-062, STORY-067). |
| Inbox -> Meetings | Meeting to-dos use the Inbox to-do call (STORY-080, STORY-064). |
| Voice -> Meetings | One audio session: dictation and calls stop while a meeting records (STORY-055, STORY-087). |
| Meetings -> Data room | A meeting is filed as a Markdown note in Data room > Recordings (STORY-085, STORY-088). |
| Data room -> Settings and trust | AI consent in the Data room and in Settings (STORY-092, STORY-120). |
| Data room (agent page) -> Team computer | The Finance agent's page, computer and artifacts are all reached from the same thread menu (STORY-097, STORY-109). |
| Business pages -> Settings and trust | Hide amounts and every Connect button end in Settings (STORY-104, STORY-124, STORY-102). |
| Business pages -> Approvals | A Connect empty state and the connect card lead to the same Integrations screen (STORY-102, STORY-044). |

## Redundancy Candidates

Input for `/ux-flow`. Each line comes from a story's Alternate paths or from a topic's note on information shown more than once.

### Duplicate paths (same goal, multiple routes)

- Archive a mail message: swipe in the list, long-press menu, the message toolbar "Archive", and Cleanup for bulk senders (STORY-057, STORY-063) - same result; only Cleanup also unsubscribes.
- Connect a model: Home banner "Connect a model", Settings > Models, and the Legal "Add your OpenRouter key" button (STORY-014, STORY-105). The Legal button opens Settings at the top level, not at Models, so it is a different and longer path.
- Connect an app: the in-thread connect card (sheet) and Settings > Integrations (pushed) are the same screen shown twice (STORY-044, STORY-119). Finance and Cap table "Connect" buttons also open Settings at the top level (STORY-102, STORY-108).
- Fix missing speech to text: Record sheet "Add speech to text" and Settings > Voice reach the same screen (STORY-054, STORY-052); Home "Connect a model" is a different setup that does not fix it.
- Answer an agent's question: the card field and the composer (STORY-038) - divergent: the composer sends a new message and does not mention the open question.
- Answer an approval: the iOS card, the web app and the Expo app; or pre-approve in "Allowed without asking" (STORY-035, STORY-121).
- Open a computer: Home "Team computer" row (the first bot's computer) and the thread menu "Open computer" (that bot's own) (STORY-115, STORY-109) - divergent targets.
- Open a meeting: Home > Meetings row, deep link, the Hex agent's thread link, and the Data room Recordings note, which is a Markdown copy, not the meeting detail (STORY-085, STORY-079, STORY-088).
- Start a recording: only the Meetings list toolbar; Home has no shortcut (STORY-077) - no duplicate, but see Gaps.
- Hide amounts: Finance toolbar and Settings toggle, one server preference (STORY-103, STORY-104); Legal and Cap table have no toggle of their own and do not reload.
- Sign out: the Settings list row and Account > Sign out, neither with a confirmation (STORY-009, STORY-126).
- Rename or archive an agent: the row long-press menu and the agent's Settings screen (STORY-016); Archive also appears in the thread menu.
- Delete a data room file: swipe in the list, the item screen toolbar and a search-result swipe (STORY-088, STORY-090).
- Delete an artifact: swipe, context menu and the More menu on the detail screen (STORY-096).
- Share a link: artifact share and agent page share are separate controls with different behavior (STORY-096, STORY-098).
- Ask the Inbox agent: the list toolbar "Ask", "Ask Inbox agent" on a message, and To do rows (STORY-056, STORY-064).
- Mark a deadline done: swipe on the row, "Mark done" on the deadline detail, and on the contract's Deadlines section; Dismiss and Keep exist only on the detail (STORY-106).
- Open the Inbox: Home row, push, `rakazo://open/inbox`, and the To do card row (STORY-056).
- Open Settings > AI data sharing consent: Settings, the Data room consent sheet, and the global consent sheet before any AI request (STORY-120, STORY-092).
- Restore an archived agent: only Settings > Archived (STORY-125); the undo toast is the only other way and it expires (STORY-016).

### Duplicate information (same fact, multiple surfaces)

- Unread count: on the Home Inbox row and again on the Inbox screen (STORY-012, STORY-056).
- An agent's name and unread state: Home row, thread header, and Settings > Archived (STORY-012, STORY-125).
- The current space name: the Home nav title and the title menu picker (STORY-018).
- A data room file's name, type and date: list row, search-result row and item screen; failed-file errors in the row and on the item screen (STORY-088, STORY-090, STORY-091).
- An artifact: Artifacts list (title, kind, "v2 of 3"), its own screen (a "v2 of 3" strip and the Versions picker), and a thread attachment (STORY-094, STORY-096).
- Meeting content: the Meetings detail and the Recordings note in the Data room; a "Summarizing your new meeting" line in the agent's thread (STORY-080, STORY-085).
- Recording state: the bar on every pushed screen, and the Meetings list toolbar hides Record while busy (STORY-082, STORY-086).
- Offline state: the thread "Offline" line (global to the queue), the Inbox (none), and the recording bar "Offline, saved here" (STORY-032, STORY-066, STORY-082).
- Money figures: Finance page, Legal values, Cap table amounts and the Finance agent's page and artifacts all show them, with Hide amounts applied separately on each (STORY-099, STORY-104, STORY-097).
- Approval reasons: the footnote under each card, the mail card hiding it after the answer, and the web card's "Clear conversation" link that iOS lacks (STORY-043).
- A to-do: Inbox To do card and meeting to-dos share one call, so a meeting to-do may appear in both (STORY-064, STORY-080).
- Account name and sign-in method: Settings profile row and Account (STORY-126).

### Overlapping features/tools

- Artifacts and Agent pages both show agent-made content. Artifact HTML runs with scripts off; an Agent page runs sandboxed HTML. The same content can behave differently (STORY-095, STORY-097) - distinct enough to keep both only if the difference is explained.
- The Finance page and the Finance agent's page both show runway and spend (STORY-099, STORY-097).
- Data room Recordings notes and Meetings detail (STORY-085, STORY-088).
- Legal deadlines, Inbox To do and meeting to-dos are three to-do lists (STORY-106, STORY-064, STORY-080).
- Cleanup and swipe Archive plus message Unsubscribe do the same bulk action in smaller steps (STORY-063, STORY-057, STORY-065).
- Dictation and Voice call both turn speech into a message; they use one audio session and both stop during a recording (STORY-046, STORY-048).
- Mail approval card and the Compose sheet both send mail; one the agent drafted, one the person wrote (STORY-040, STORY-067).
- Compose "Save draft" and the agent's drafts: drafts save to the server but there is no drafts list (STORY-071).
- Models settings and Voice settings both take provider keys; the Home banner fixes only models (STORY-014, STORY-052).
- Team computer and Private computer are one screen with two titles (STORY-109).
- Settings Integrations and the in-thread connect card (STORY-044, STORY-119).
- Archived agents (Settings) and the archive undo toast (STORY-125, STORY-016).

## Gaps & Recommendations

- **Routines** (list, detail, pause and resume, history) are built (`Routines/*`) and in the discovery Feature Map but no topic has a story. The old plan-era `computer-artifacts.md` described them from design boards; its text was not carried over because it describes planned screens. Suggested: two stories (pause a routine from the list; read a routine's history and Load more).
- **New message from the Inbox** cannot be walked because no UI path exists (finding 5). Suggested: a story to add after a Compose button exists; until then keep STORY-075 as the only no-account case.
- **Message block types** other than text and tool steps (tables, images, files, subagent steps, unsupported blocks) have no story. Suggested: one thread story with a table, an image and an unknown block, including horizontal scrolling inside the vertical thread (finding 54).
- **Bot and Group settings** screens: section picker, color, role, delete group and the discard-changes dialog on Back. Suggested: one medium story.
- **Deep links** other than meetings and bot threads (`inbox/<id>`, `finance`, `legal`, `cap-table`, `data-room`, `artifact/<id>`, `routine/<id>`, the `bot/<id>/...` family) and deep links while signed out. Suggested: one short story per link family, run from the command line with `xcrun simctl openurl`.
- **Capture recovery**: resume after relaunch, an unrecoverable capture alert and chunk-upload retry. Suggested: one long story with the app killed mid-recording.
- **Sign-in capability states**: "Retry connection" and "No sign-in method is available on this server". Suggested: one short story against a server that reports no methods.
- **Accessibility and Dynamic Type**: only the fixed-height sheets (finding 51) mention large text. Suggested: a pass at the largest text size and with VoiceOver on Home, Thread and Inbox, as stories with the same persona.
- **Real-service stories** need a demo stack and cannot be walked offline: Gmail (Inbox, Compose), transcription (Record), Mercury, Brex and Carta, SSO, and push. Push registration is not wired, so only synthetic notifications work.
- **Cross-topic long stories** worth adding: morning routine (open app, approve a tool, triage mail, check Finance, start a meeting recording); first day on a new phone (sign in, connect model, create agent, send a message, connect Gmail, first Cleanup); a day with a recording (record, read mail, answer an approval, stop, read the summary).
- **Walk order**: finding 1 first (Inbox and an email do not scroll), then findings 2 to 4 (thread scrolling), then 5 to 15, then the stale-list cluster (27 to 34).
